	Classification of heart attack using SVM
  
In this project the classification of heart attack disease of ECG signals dataset is used. The disease is classified using supervised learning SVM classification algorithm. The dataset contains 200 samples and 96 features set and 1 target variable attribute which contains the values in{0,1} where 0 indicates not having heart attack problem and 1 indicates persons having heart attack problem. For SVM linear kernel function is used.
